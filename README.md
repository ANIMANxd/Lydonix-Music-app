# LYDONIX - Your Music, Your Vibe

LYDONIX is a minimalist web-based music player that allows users to search and play music from YouTube. It features a sleek, dark-themed interface and a simple login page for access.

This project is a great example of a front-end application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating modern design principles and API integration.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** A simple login page with predefined credentials to gate access to the main application.

* **YouTube Music Search:** Search for any music track or video using the YouTube Data API.

* **Responsive Design:** The interface adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

* **Player Controls:** Play, pause, skip, and adjust the volume with intuitive on-screen controls.

* **Progress Bar:** Track and seek through the current song with a visual progress bar.

* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Control playback with keyboard shortcuts (Spacebar for play/pause, Arrow keys for next/previous, 'M' to mute).

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the application structure.

* **CSS3:** For styling and animations, including a dark theme and responsive layout.

* **JavaScript (ES6):** For all the application logic, including API calls, DOM manipulation, and player control.

* **YouTube Iframe Player API:** To embed and control YouTube videos.

* **YouTube Data API:** To perform music searches.

* **Font Awesome:** For all the icons used in the player controls and search bar.
